\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First and foremost, you should write about the most interesting or important
 parts of your project.
 Devote most space and time to this.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What design choices did you have along the way, and why did you make the
 choices you made? What was the most difficult part of the project? Why
 was it difficult? How did you overcome the difficulties? Did you discover
 anything novel? What did you learn?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Set the scene and problem statement/specification.
 Provide the motivation for reading this report.
 Introduce the structure of report (what you will cover in which chapters).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
You should provide enough background to the reader for them to understand
 what the project is all about.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What the reader needs to know in order to understand the rest of the report.
 Examiners like to know that you have done some background research and
 that you know what else has been done in the field (where relevant).
 Try to include some references.
 Related work (if you know of any) What problem are you solving? Why are
 you solving it? How does this relate to other work in this area? What work
 does it build on?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
For 'research-style' projects - ones in which a computational technique
 (for example neural networks, genetic algorithms, finite element analysis,
 ray tracing) is used to explore or extend the properties of a mathematical
 model, or to make predictions of some kind - it may be a good idea to split
 this chapter into two shorter ones, one covering the computational technique
 itself and one the area of application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The Examiners are just as interested in the process you went through in
 performing your project work as the results you finally produced.
 So, make sure your reports concentrate on why you made the particular choices
 and decisions that you did.
 We are looking for reasoned arguments and for critical assessment.
 This is especially so where design, implementation and engineering decisions
 have been made not just on technical merit but under pressure of non-functional
 requirements and external influences.

The inner workings of the compiler are heavily influenced by a course the
 author took on compilers at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin under Peter
 Pepper and Judith Rohloff.
 While no code is reused, the structure of the compiler is very similar.

\begin_layout Section
Concurrency Paradigms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is commonly understood that writing software is hard.
 The development of programming languages is a response to this problem.
 The common pattern is that flexible features that are easily used to write
 code that is hard to reason about are replaced by, often several, less
 flexible features.
 After all, the less flexible a feature is, the more predictable its use
 is.
 Three examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
goto replaced by sequence, selection and iteration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "structured proof"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pointers replaced by indexes and references 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mutable variables replaced by immutable values 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, one can observe that as each feature becomes easier to reason
 about, the total number of features increase.
 For example, to eliminate mutation, one needs to also eliminate iteration.
 One way to do this is by using recursion, which is a full replacement for
 iteration.
 But recursion, while allowing immutability, is often harder for humans
 to understand [citation needed].
 To ameliorate this problem, a variety of machanisms have been implemented,
 for example map and fold, which performs common functions previously performed
 utilizing iteration.
 In this manner, the number of features often increase in the interest of
 analysability.
 Is this generally true? And if so, at what point does the drawbacks of
 increasing feature number outweigh the benefit of increased analyzability
 and predictability? Answering these questions is outside the scope of this
 report.
 Much progress has been made in making programs easier to understand and
 analyze in this fashion, yet there is always room for improvement.
 In later years, one feature in particular has risen to notability: Concurrency.
 In the past, concurrency has not been an issue for most programmers but
 as multi-processor (or multi-core) systems have gone mainstream, so has
 multithreaded programming
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "free lunch over"

\end_inset

.
 The problems inherent to concurrency can roughly be divided into two categories
: Communication and scheduling; making sure the correct information is shared
 between threads in a correct way and making sure tasks are done at correct
 times, respectively[citation needed].
 One possibility is to let the programmer deal with these problems in an
 application-specific way.
 This is notoriously error-prone, however.
 Several abstractions have been deviced for dealing with the two concurrency
 problems in a systematic manner, to the author's knowledge:

\begin_layout Itemize
Synchronous programming
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Esterel"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end we decided on using the synchronous programming paradigm.
 There are tradeoffs associated with chosing synchronous programming, but
 they were determined to be preferable to the alternatives.
 The main problems with synchronous programming are 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Difficulty in scaling beyond one physical machine.
 The cost of global synchronization grows with latency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Performance loss due to processing resources idling as the synchronicity
 abstraction requires all operations to use the same amount of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Synchronous programming therefore has substantial problems, yet for single-machi
ne systems it presents a way to achieve multi-threaded performance and achitectu
re but with single-threaded predictability and therefore debugability.
 While the other abstractions place the responsibility for correct concurrent
 behaviour on the programmer, synchronous programming takes care of that
 and replaces it with the responsibility for performance, as the program
 performs best if all threads has an equal amount of work.
 Let us discuss the problems of the other abstractions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Actors assume infinite message queues, with the failure mode being a loss
 of information.
 In a producer-consumer relationship, producer actors can overwhelm consumer
 actors.
 Actors are designed to mimic distributed systems and create a unified abstracti
on over these.
 Distributed systems have to correctly handle hardware failures, so loss
 of information is an acceptible failure mode for actors.
 However, this makes actors unsuitable for real-time systems as recovering
 from data loss and unpredictable memory usage are unacceptable tradeoffs.
 Ordering of IO is alse unpredictable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CSP systems use synchronous communication and therefore avoid the message
 queue problem of actors entirely.
 In exchange, they are open to deadlock, and the ordering of IO is unpredictable.
 CSP therefore requires brute force search for deadlocks, and debugging
 is harder than for single-threaded systems.
 Despite this, it is regarded as a solid choice for real time systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transactional memory, though it makes it look as if thread communication
 is easy, has its own problems.
 The unpredictability of the sequence of writing is a problem, as well as
 the unpredictable time it takes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What The Author Learned
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Analysis and Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
If your project involves designing a system, give a good high-level overview
 of your design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In many projects, the initial design and the final design differ somewhat.
 If the differences are interesting, write about them, and why the changes
 were made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
If your design was not implemented fully, describe which parts you did implement
, and which you didn't.
 If the reason you didn't implement everything is interesting (eg it turned
 out to be difficult for unexpected reasons), write about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, the goal of this thesis was to create a fundamentally new approach
 to managing concurrency, wherein the programmer would manually schedule
 the execution of tasks at compile time.
 Tasks would be allowed to write to special variables which would be used
 in lieu of final ones if the task could not finish in the alloted time
 frame.
 This effort was abandoned because of the burden it would impose on the
 programmer, the perceived difficulty of implementation and the unsatisfactory
 failure modes.
 Instead, it was decided that an approach belonging to the tradition of
 synchronous programming would be preferable.
 Given the importance of a familiar superficialities for language adoption
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Language adoption"

\end_inset

, it was decided that the language should have a familiar C/Algol-style
 syntax, rather than invent or adopt something less common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Language Design Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the goals of Fumurt to aid in producing correct programs suitable
 for real-time applications in general, and such multithreaded programs
 in particular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Runtime Execution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the programming language is to make a multithreaded program
 behave as predictably as were it singlethreaded and, more generally, to
 help create reliable applications A corollary of this is that only changes
 of state that are visible to a single thread can happen concurrently.
 All IO and inter-thread communication are required happen in a statically
 determined sequence.
 One way to do this is to have the program have two alternating phases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Computational phase: In which computations local to a thread are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Communicative phase: In which IO is effected and shared variables are updated,
 all in a single-threaded manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the computational phase, the order in which computations are performed
 on the processor is irrelevant as nothing is shared between the thread
 and the rest of the world.
 Since the threads have no effect on each other or the outside world in
 this phase, the only difference between concurrent execution and sequential
 execution is speed.
 In the communicative phase, however, execution has to be single threaded.
 Using this scheme, the application appears to be single threaded both to
 itself and to the rest of the world, all the while enabling separation
 of concerns and better utilization of multi-core systems.
 The following figure illustrates the principle:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

	filename architecture.eps
	lyxscale 70
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the actual execution a more detailed figure is offered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename archdetailed.eps
	lyxscale 70
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observe that in the computational stage we can make available parallel list
 transformations like map and fold or even futures, without affecting the
 outward behaviour of the system, except for performance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename archdetailedwithmap.eps
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Futures and parallel list comprehensions are together applicable to all
 problems which can be divided into subproblems that can be done in parallel
 without communication.
 Futures are a bit of extra work to deal with, but the map-and-fold pattern,
 sometimes called mapReduce
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mapReduce"

\end_inset

, is easy to use and widely applicative to many problems.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hadoop at facebook"

\end_inset

 Indeed, map-and-fold is intensely used in the Fumurt compiler.
 Supporting map-and-fold and futures reduces the performance problems of
 all threads waiting on each other significantly as long as it can be applied
 to the most time-consuming task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Intermediat Target
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For easy debugging and wide selection of binary targets we chose to first
 compile to an intermediate language and then let an external compiler perform
 the final transformation to binary form.
 This is a well-trodden path
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Haskell-to-C"

\end_inset

, and C is often used.
 Though many modern languages would be suitable for this, we had a wishlist
 of features that determined which language to choose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
No garbage collection or other other source of run-to-run variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wide selection of final targets, including embedded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low overhead, whether in performance or memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A solid set of features to make transformation into the language easier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mature standard that is unlikely to break backwards compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C++ seems to satisfy all these criteria, and were therefore selected as
 the intermediate language.
 In particular, C has too few features, which means a transformation will
 have to make more difficult transformations and/or we would need to manually
 implement things like linked lists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Compiler Implementation Language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scala was chosen as the implementation language for the compiler partly
 because it's what the author used in the TU Berlin compiler bau course
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:TUB course"

\end_inset

) and already had lots of experience in, but it also has some highly attractive
 qualities for making a compiler:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A solid type checking which makes the code easier to work with, especially
 when refactoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A wide selection of functional abstractions, which allows compact code and
 eliminates simple but irritating bugs as well as access to imperative construct
s like loops etc.
 when this is more convenient
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A parser combinator library
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fast execution time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Syntax is by definition somewhat arbitrary, but as Brainfuck demonstrates,
 some syntaxes are better than others.
 We settled on the following goals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Look modern and familiar.
 This is supposed to make it easier to learn, as well as more appealing
 to someone evaluating whether to learn it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Be simple.
 For ease of implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Be predictable, and aid the programmer in the understanding of the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modern and Familiar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fumurt adopts several conventions from contemporary languages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Separating expressions with line endings instead of special characters (for
 example semicolon).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Employ 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

instanceOfType:Type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Type instanceOfType
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when declaring the type of something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to perform definitions and mark the boundaries of blocks with brackets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This results in syntax with a distinctly modern look:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function integerIdentity(x:Integer):Integer = {x}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might wish for brackets to be optional in such one-liners, though, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simple
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Predictable and Helpful
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observe that although modern languages and their type systems have made
 the use of functions safe, the syntax of modern languages insufficiently
 aid the programmer in understanding what a function does, as it is called:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Functions that perform IO or mutate shared variables are called actions
 and their names must begin with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, like so:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionPrintFoo:Nothing =
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  actionPrint("  FOO   ")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

Similarly for threads and synchronized variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Function arguments, if there are more than one, are distinguished not by
 relative position, but by name (as is optionally available in Python).
 Here we see a call to the if function and some calls to the toString function:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if(condition=true, then=toString(1), else=toString(0))
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the goal of goal of this programming language to help the programmer
 underst
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In keeping with our goal of being modern and familiar, we allow definitions
 of functions inside other definitions of functions.
 Recursive function definitions, that is.
 This decision begets more decisions:

This covers different areas to the 'Testing' chapter, and is appropriate

 Why were certain experiments carried out but not others? What were the
 important parameters in the simulation and how did they affect the results?
 If there are very many graphs and tables associated with this chapter they
 may be put in the Appendix, but it is generally better to keep these close
 to the text they illustrate, as this is easier for the reader.
