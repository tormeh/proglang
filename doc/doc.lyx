\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
First and foremost, you should write about the most interesting or important
 parts of your project.
 Devote most space and time to this.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What design choices did you have along the way, and why did you make the
 choices you made? What was the most difficult part of the project? Why
 was it difficult? How did you overcome the difficulties? Did you discover
 anything novel? What did you learn?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Set the scene and problem statement/specification.
 Provide the motivation for reading this report.
 Introduce the structure of report (what you will cover in which chapters).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
You should provide enough background to the reader for them to understand
 what the project is all about.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What the reader needs to know in order to understand the rest of the report.
 Examiners like to know that you have done some background research and
 that you know what else has been done in the field (where relevant).
 Try to include some references.
 Related work (if you know of any) What problem are you solving? Why are
 you solving it? How does this relate to other work in this area? What work
 does it build on?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
For 'research-style' projects - ones in which a computational technique
 (for example neural networks, genetic algorithms, finite element analysis,
 ray tracing) is used to explore or extend the properties of a mathematical
 model, or to make predictions of some kind - it may be a good idea to split
 this chapter into two shorter ones, one covering the computational technique
 itself and one the area of application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The Examiners are just as interested in the process you went through in
 performing your project work as the results you finally produced.
 So, make sure your reports concentrate on why you made the particular choices
 and decisions that you did.
 We are looking for reasoned arguments and for critical assessment.
 This is especially so where design, implementation and engineering decisions
 have been made not just on technical merit but under pressure of non-functional
 requirements and external influences.

\begin_layout Section
Prior Knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inner workings of the compiler are heavily influenced by a course the
 author took on compilers at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin under Peter
 Pepper and Judith Rohloff.
 While no code is reused, the structure of the compiler is very similar.

\begin_layout Section
Concurrency Paradigms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is commonly understood that writing software is hard.
 The development of programming languages is a response to this problem.
 The common pattern is that flexible features that are easily used to write
 code that is hard to reason about are replaced by, often several, less
 flexible features.
 After all, the less flexible a feature is, the more predictable its use
 is.
 Three examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
goto replaced by sequence, selection and iteration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bohm1966flowStructuredProgramming"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pointers replaced by indexes and references 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mutable variables replaced by immutable values 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, one can observe that as each feature becomes easier to reason
 about, the total number of features increase.
 For example, to eliminate mutation, one needs to also eliminate iteration.
 One way to do this is by using recursion, which is a full replacement for
 iteration.
 But recursion, while allowing immutability, is often harder for humans
 to understand [citation needed].
 To ameliorate this problem, a variety of machanisms have been implemented,
 for example map and fold, which performs common functions previously performed
 utilizing iteration.
 In this manner, the number of features often increase in the interest of
 analysability.
 Is this generally true? And if so, at what point does the drawbacks of
 increasing feature number outweigh the benefit of increased analyzability
 and predictability? Answering these questions is outside the scope of this
 report.
 Much progress has been made in making programs easier to understand and
 analyze in this fashion, yet there is always room for improvement.
 In later years, one feature in particular has risen to notability: Concurrency.
 In the past, concurrency has not been an issue for most programmers but
 as multi-processor (or multi-core) systems have gone mainstream, so has
 multithreaded programming
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sutter2005freeLunch"

\end_inset

.
 The problems inherent to concurrency can roughly be divided into two categories
: Communication and scheduling; making sure the correct information is shared
 between threads in a correct way and making sure tasks are done at correct
 times, respectively[citation needed].
 One possibility is to let the programmer deal with these problems in an
 application-specific way.
 This is notoriously error-prone, however.
 Several abstractions have been deviced for dealing with the two concurrency
 problems in a systematic manner, to the author's knowledge:

Transactional memory[citation needed]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Synchronous programming
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "berry1992esterel"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end we decided on using the synchronous programming paradigm.
 There are tradeoffs associated with chosing synchronous programming, but
 they were determined to be preferable to the alternatives.
 The main problems with synchronous programming are 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Difficulty in scaling beyond one physical machine.
 The cost of global synchronization grows with latency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Performance loss due to processing resources idling as the synchronicity
 abstraction requires all operations to use the same amount of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Synchronous programming therefore has substantial problems, yet for single-machi
ne systems it presents a way to achieve multi-threaded performance and achitectu
re but with single-threaded predictability and therefore debugability.
 While the other abstractions place the responsibility for correct concurrent
 behaviour on the programmer, synchronous programming takes care of that
 and replaces it with the responsibility for performance, as the program
 performs best if all threads has an equal amount of work.
 Let us discuss the problems of the other abstractions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Actors assume infinite message queues, with the failure mode being a loss
 of information.
 In a producer-consumer relationship, producer actors can overwhelm consumer
 actors.
 Actors are designed to mimic distributed systems and create a unified abstracti
on over these.
 Distributed systems have to correctly handle hardware failures, so loss
 of information is an acceptible failure mode for actors.
 However, this makes actors unsuitable for real-time systems as recovering
 from data loss and unpredictable memory usage are unacceptable tradeoffs.
 Ordering of IO is also unpredictable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CSP systems use synchronous communication and therefore avoid the message
 queue problem of actors entirely.
 In exchange, they are open to deadlock, and the ordering of IO is unpredictable.
 CSP therefore requires brute force search for deadlocks, and debugging
 is harder than for single-threaded systems.
 Despite this, it is regarded as a solid choice for real time systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transactional memory, though it makes it look as if thread communication
 is easy, has its own problems.
 The unpredictability of the sequence of writing is a problem, as well as
 the unpredictable time it takes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Compilers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A compiler is a program (one may regard it as a function) that accepts a
 program in a source format and outputs a corresponding program in a target
 format.
 The source and target format may differ in terms of encoding, language
 and any other way one may imagine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This figure, reconstructed from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cooper2011engineering"

\end_inset

, illustrates the structure of a typical compiler:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename textbookcompiler.eps
	lyxscale 70
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The front end accepts source text and transforms it into an intermediate
 representation that is easier to work with.
 It is generally independent of the target format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The optimizer improves the code as encoded in the intermediate representation.
 The improvement is usually done with regards to performance, code size
 or memory usage .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The back end accepts the intermediate representation and outputs the the
 program encoded therein translated to the target format.
 It can be independent of the source format, depending on how general and
 flexible the intermediate representation is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the compiler described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Implementation"

\end_inset

 does not deal with optimization and conversion to binary itself, but rather
 outsources this to a C++ compiler, all of the difficult material on instruction
 selection, scheduling and register allocation is of no relevance.
 The parts of relevance to this report is the front end and a relatively
 simple back end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the parts of the front end:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename textbookfrontend.eps
	lyxscale 70
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scanner: Transforms source text into a list of tokens (simple objects),
 possibly ignoring some symbols (such as spaces, comments, indentation etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parser: Transforms a list of tokens into an abstract syntax tree.
 In the process, it checks whether the syntax of the program is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Context Sensitive Analysis: Checks the correctness of program semantics.
 Most interpreted languages skip this step and deal with semantic errors
 at runtime.
 The correct time to do semantic analysis is not a settled matter, but in
 a static compiler such as the one in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Implementation"

\end_inset

 it is done here.
 In the case where a language has type inference, this step may emit a modified
 intermediate representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The back end is composed of successive passes, of which every step transform
 the input intermediate representation into an output that is closer to
 the target format.
 The number of passes required vary greatly and depend on the differences
 between the source and ouput formats.
 In the trivial case, where the input and output format is identical (for
 example C to C) the number of necessary passes would be zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Grammars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A grammar is a formal and complete description of the syntax of a language.
 It is mostly used for programming languages.
 It consists of the confusingly named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

production rules
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a notion of a lower case letter can be described like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

lower case letter = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i"
 | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u"
 | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signify the two sides of the production rule, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

|
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signify alternation (intuitively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), quotes signify a string and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

;
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signify the end of the rule.
 Let us expand the example by describing a lower case word:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

lower case word = lower case letter, {lower case letter};
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the correctness of the word as it pertains to English is ignored.
 The comma signify a sequence, and the curly brackets signify that their
 contents can be repeated one or more time.
 A lower case word, as it has been defined here, is simply one lower case
 letter, followed by zero or more lower case letters.
 Next we can do the same for sentences, again ignoring rules for English:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

lower case sentence = lower case word, {(", ", lower case word) | (" ",
 lower case word)}, ".
 ";
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parentheses allows grouping of sequences.
 Here, it allows us to alternate between sequences of symbols rather than
 just single symbols.
 Finally we say that:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

lower case text = lower case sentence, {lower case sentence}; 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have a very simple grammar, which allows us to partition up a text
 into sentences and words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Abstract Syntax Trees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now suppose we wanted to systematize a string of characters according to
 the grammar above.
 A data structure corresponding to the grammar would be appropriate.
 Consider the following figure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Abstract Syntax Tree.eps
	lyxscale 70
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an abstract syntax tree, often abreviated AST.
 An abstract syntax tree is a tree, in the computer science sense, that
 represents the production of the source string from the grammar.
 In code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Text(val sentences:List[Sentence])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Sentence(val words:List[Word])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Word(val letters:List[Char])
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Parser Combinators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A parser combinator is a higher order function that accepts parsers as input
 and returns a new parser
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Parser combinators"

\end_inset

.
 The overall effect is similar to a domain specific language for constructing
 recursive descent parsers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A parser is a function that converts one data structure to a more sensible
 data structure.
 Usually, the output data structure is more restricted and systematic than
 the input one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a function that accepts the string 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and returns an object of class equalToken or, if the string it is given
 is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, returns an error object.
 Such a function is then a parser.
 Such parsers can be combined to form a larger parser that can work as a
 scanner, that is a parser that converts a list of characters to a list
 of tokens (very simple objects).
 Let the previously discussed function be called the equalParser.
 Let a parser that works exactly the same, save for exchanging 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 be called the minusParser and let it return a minusToken upon success.
 Consider combining the equalParser with the minusParser using an 
\emph on
alternate parser combinator
\emph default
 (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

|
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operator in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Scala-Parser"

\end_inset

).
 The resulting function would then first try the equalParser, and if that
 returned an error object, it would try the minusParser, returning an error
 object if both of these parsers fail.
 This new parser would not need to return a minusToken or equalToken, but
 can process the results from equalParser and minusParser into something
 new.
 In this example, we have formed two parsers and combined them into a new
 parser using a parser combinator.
 This new parser can be part of a scanner.
 Indeed, the Fumurt scanner is formed like this (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "scanner combined"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Conflicting terminology:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately there is a case of conflicting terminology concerning the
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parser
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Here we refer to parser in two senses: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The parser as defined above.
 A function that converts one data structure to a more sensible data structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A parser as a compilation step that converts a list of tokens into an abstract
 syntax tree

Elaboration of the problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, the goal of this thesis was to create a fundamentally new approach
 to managing concurrency, wherein the programmer would manually schedule
 the execution of tasks at compile time.
 Tasks would be allowed to write to special variables which would be used
 in lieu of final ones if the task could not finish in the alloted time
 frame.
 This effort was abandoned because of the burden it would impose on the
 programmer, the perceived difficulty of implementation and the unsatisfactory
 failure modes.
 Instead, it was decided that an approach belonging to the tradition of
 synchronous programming would be preferable.
 Given the importance of a familiar superficialities for language adoption
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "meyerovich2013empiricalProgrammingLanguageAdoption"

\end_inset

, it was decided that the language should have a familiar C/Algol-style
 syntax, rather than invent or adopt something less common.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Language Design Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the goals of Fumurt to aid in producing correct programs suitable
 for real-time applications in general, and such multithreaded programs
 in particular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Runtime Execution Model
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Runtime-Execution-Model"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the programming language is to make a multithreaded program
 behave as predictably as were it singlethreaded and, more generally, to
 help create reliable applications A corollary of this is that only changes
 of state that are visible to a single thread can happen concurrently.
 All IO and inter-thread communication are required happen in a statically
 determined sequence.
 One way to do this is to have the program have two alternating phases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Computational phase: In which computations local to a thread are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Communicative phase: In which IO is effected and shared variables are updated,
 all in a single-threaded manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the computational phase, the order in which computations are performed
 on the processor is irrelevant as nothing is shared between the thread
 and the rest of the world.
 Since the threads have no effect on each other or the outside world in
 this phase, the only difference between concurrent execution and sequential
 execution is speed.
 In the communicative phase, however, execution has to be single threaded.
 Using this scheme, the application appears to be single threaded both to
 itself and to the rest of the world, all the while enabling separation
 of concerns and better utilization of multi-core systems.
 The following figure illustrates the principle:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observe that in the computational stage we can make available parallel list
 transformations like map and fold or even futures, without affecting the
 outward behaviour of the system, except for performance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Futures and parallel list comprehensions are together applicable to all
 problems which can be divided into subproblems that can be done in parallel
 without communication.
 Futures are a bit of extra work to deal with, but the map-and-fold pattern,
 sometimes called mapReduce
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mapReduce"

\end_inset

, is easy to use and widely applicative to many problems.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "borthakur2011apache"

\end_inset

 Indeed, map-and-fold is intensely used in the Fumurt compiler.
 Supporting map-and-fold and futures reduces the performance problems of
 all threads waiting on each other significantly as long as it can be applied
 to the most time-consuming task.

Syntax

 some syntaxes are better than others.

\begin_layout Itemize
Look modern and familiar.
 This is supposed to make it easier to learn, as well as more appealing
 to someone evaluating whether to learn it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 example semicolon).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Employ

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the use of functions safe, the syntax of modern languages insufficiently
 aid the programmer in understanding what a function does, as it is called:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Functions that perform IO or mutate shared variables are called actions
 and their names must begin with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, like so:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionPrintFoo:Nothing =
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  actionPrint("  FOO   ")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

Similarly thread names begin with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thread
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and synchronized variable names begin with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

synchronized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Function arguments, if there are more than one, are distinguished not by
 relative position, but by name (as is optionally available in Python).
 Here we see a call to the if function and some calls to the toString function:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if(condition=true, then=toString(1), else=toString(0))
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the goals of this programming language is to help the programmer understan
d the program.
 One way we do this is to make dependencies between functions explicit via
 
\emph on
inclusions
\emph default
.
 It is common among languages for changes in one function to affect the
 correctness of seemingly unrelated parts of the program.
 In the following example, changing the definition of function c affects
 the output of function a:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionA:Nothing = 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  b()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionB:Nothing =
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  c()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionC:Nothing =
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  actionPrint("string")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above example is a bit contrived, it illustrates the problem.
 Using inclusions, the dependencies become explicit:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionA(b:Inclusion, c:Inclusion):Nothing = 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  b(c=c)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionB(c:Inclusion):Nothing =
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  c()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

action actionC:Nothing =
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  actionPrint("string")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that inclusions are not functions as arguments - the passed function
 and the name of the inclusion must have the same name; it is simply there
 to make dependencies between functions explicit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In keeping with our goal of being modern and familiar, we allow definitions
 of functions inside other definitions of functions.
 Recursive function definitions, that is.
 This means that developers can hide functions inside other functions when
 they are not needed outside them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Operators are functions with two arguments and the function name in between
 the arguments.
 There are multiple problems with them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convention suggests that their names should be information-anemically short,
 often one character.
 This is obviously problematic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Their arguments are nameless, which kind of sabotages the point of having
 named arguments for functions a little
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How to define operator precedence? For math operators there's convention,
 but otherwise this may be confusing for users of operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A prime example of unhelpful operator behaviour is found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-Scala-Parser"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We haven't found any good solutions to this, but it's hard to argue with
 the convenience of operators.
 We provide some predictability to operators by enforcing the following
 rules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Either the types of the two arguments has to be the same or one of the types
 have to be a container type of the other.
 For example Int and Int or List[Int] and Int.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There's no operator precedence, it has to be defined on a case-by-case basis
 using parentheses.
 Ambiguous use of operators are not allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Immutability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mutable variables are a major source of bugs, and even experienced developers
 create bugs when a variable that would have held the correct information
 previously no longer holds that information.
 At the same time we need mutable values in some ways in order to share
 information across threads.
 So we disallow mutable variables, except the synchronized variables that
 are shared across threads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Loops
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Loops are familiar for many people, yet are usually not included in languages
 with only immutable values, because their utility is pretty limited.
 However, they are convenient and they are equivalent to tail-recursion.
 The major advantages of tail recursion over looping is that the assignment
 and dependencies are explicit.
 We decided we could make loops that are as safe as tail recursion while
 being almost as friendly as loops:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

value y:Int = 5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

value x:Int = loop(y=y,x=y)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  if(
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  condition=(y>0), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  then=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  x = x*y 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  y = y-1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  continue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  }, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

  else=break)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All variables passed to the loop would then need to be copied.
 In the example above, the y modified inside the loop cannot be the same
 that is defined outside it.
 Such scoping of variables are common in function calls, and a similar mechanism
 can be used for loops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional benefit of loops is that their use has constant memory consumption
 independent of number of iterations.
 While the same can be achieved using tail recursion with optimizing compilers,
 such compilers are still not the norm.
 Mutual tail recursion optimization is particularly rare.
 Since optimizations are not an immediate goal for the Fumurt compiler,
 loops would offer an important guarantee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we try to be familiar we want to provide types along with their
 popular object oriented nomenclature.
 So we have classes, just that they are immutable.
 They are defined by their constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class IntAndString(int:Integer, string:String)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

value x = IntAndString(int=3, string="something")
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not have inheritance, because while inheritance means you get code
 reuse, it also obscures the class that inherits.
 When one class inherits from a hierarchy, one needs to understand not only
 what's written about that class but also the entire hierarchy in order
 to understand the end result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to aid the programmer in understanding their own and others' code,
 the names of types always lead with a capital letter.
 Conversely, leading with a capital letter for anything else is illegal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All classes are interfaces, but one can also create interfaces that aren't
 classes using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 keyword.
 When implementing an interface one explicitly have to note what interfaces
 the class is implementing.

\begin_layout Section
Choice of Intermediate Target
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For easy debugging and wide selection of binary targets we chose to first
 compile to an intermediate language and then let an external compiler perform
 the final transformation to binary form.
 This is a well-trodden path
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hall1993glasgowHaskellToC"

\end_inset

, and C is often used.
 Though many modern languages would be suitable for this, we had a wishlist
 of features that determined which language to choose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
No garbage collection or other other source of run-to-run variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wide selection of final targets, including embedded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Low overhead, whether in performance or memory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A solid set of features to make transformation into the language easier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mature standard that is unlikely to break backwards compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C++ seems to satisfy all these criteria, and were therefore selected as
 the intermediate language.
 In particular, C has too few features, which means a compiler would have
 to make more difficult transformations and/or things like linked lists
 would have to be manually implemented.
 Such difficulties seem unnecessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Choice of Compiler Implementation Language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scala was chosen as the implementation language for the compiler partly
 because it's what the author used in the TU Berlin compiler bau course
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:TUB course"

\end_inset

) and already had lots of experience in, but it also has some highly attractive
 qualities for making a compiler:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A solid type checking which makes the code easier to work with, especially
 when refactoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A wide selection of functional abstractions, which allows compact code and
 eliminates simple but irritating bugs as well as access to imperative construct
s like loops etc.

\begin_layout Standard
Our execution model formulated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 needs be formulated in the compiled C++ code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each thread gets its own printList (type std::list<std::string>), and actionPrin
ts are translated into printList.push_back.
 The same principle can be used for future output as well.
 When the threads are finished with the computational phase, the last thread
 to finish will print printList.pop_front until the printList is empty.
 The thread started first in the program statement gets its printList emptied
 first, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We use a rendezvous pattern:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We define a macro NUMTOPTHREADS, with the number of threads defined in the
 program statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We define a static std::atomic<int> rendezvousCounter, which holds the number
 of threads that have arrived at the rendezvous point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We define a static std::mutex rendezvousSyncMutex and a static std::condition_va
riable cv.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each synchronized variable in the source code, we define one variable
 which holds the global state of this variable and one which holds the local
 state of this variable in the thread that is allowed to write to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We define a [[noreturn]] static void threadName() for each thread, holding
 its values.
 All arguments to thread in the source code are converted to static global
 variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We define a main function, inside of which:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
rendezvousCounter is set to 0, std::thread are started with the thread functions
 (defined in previous step) as arguments and finally the main function enters
 a loop executing std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1)).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We define a static void waitForRendezvous(std::string name) which a thread
 calls when it is ready to wait.
 Inside of which:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The thread locks the rendezvousSyncMutex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increments the rendezvousCounter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the value in the rendezvousCounter is less than NUMTOPTHREADS, the thread
 waits using cv.wait, at which point rendezvousSyncMutex will be automatically
 unlocked.
 If the rendezvousCounter equals NUMTOPTHREADS, the thread prints all strings
 held in the printLists as described above, sets any global synchronized
 variables to its local values, sets rendezvousCounter to 0 and finally
 notifies all other threads using cv.notify_all before exiting the function.
 rendezvousSyncMutex is unlocked on function exit.
 Consider the salient details:

A Need for Annotation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Technically, the finished code can always be determined directly from the
 AST, but it was discovered that in order to do this in the Fumurt case,
 the same rules would have to be encoded into the code in several different
 places.
 In the current state of implementation, the only rule that required annotation
 was the rule for determining the C++ names of function.
 There are three aspects to the naming: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Actions and functions that are in other functions need to get new names
 and the hierarchy needs to be flattened
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Actions need to be demultiplexed, as their C++ code needs to be different
 depending on which thread calls that action.
 For instance, an actionPrint needs to be transformed to a push to a list
 whose name depends on the calling thread
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Function calls need to be changed so they refer to the new names

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compiler consists of four parts: The scanner, parser, checker and code
 generator.
 There is no optimizer, although the requirement for no dynamic destruction
 or creation allows us to use a loop in threads instead of just recursion.
 This is necessary because neither Clang nor GCC could correctly optimize
 that tail recursion into a loop in testing, leading to a stack overflow.

Positional

 is a trait that gives the token a Position.
 The

positioned
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 call in the parsers assigns the Position to the token.
 This is all inherited from the parser combinator library, so it's hard

 The

positioned

Checker

\begin_layout Standard
The checker, contrary to its in-source name (FumurtTypeChecker) checks more
 than types.
 It does not modify, annotate or otherwise change the abstract syntax tree.
 It simply returns errors found or returns nothing.
 When the implementation of the checker began it was envisaged that the
 basic functions would be treated equally with user defined functions, but
 due to the lack of generics and other abstraction mechanisms, most of the
 basic functions still needed special treatment, with

Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generator holds classes needed to annotate the AST, for example 
\emph on
class aDefinition(val leftside:aDefLhs, val rightside:aDefRhs).
 
\emph default
Existing AST classes are used unless extra information needs to be held
 or it is a parent of such a class.
 The most dramatic example is 
\emph on
class aDefLhs(val description:DefDescriptionT, val id:IdT, val cppid:IdT,
 val callingthread:String, val args:Option[Arguments], val returntype:TypeT)
\emph default
.
 In cases where functions need to be demultiplexed, the new AST will be
 modified to hold those as well.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
This covers different areas to the 'Testing' chapter, and is appropriate
 for 'research style' projects.
 For such projects this chapter should detail the types of experiments/simulatio
ns that were carried out with the code written.
 Why were certain experiments carried out but not others? What were the
 important parameters in the simulation and how did they affect the results?
 If there are very many graphs and tables associated with this chapter they
 may be put in the Appendix, but it is generally better to keep these close
 to the text they illustrate, as this is easier for the reader.

What have you achieved? Give a critical appraisal (evaluation) of your own
 work - how could the work be taken further (perhaps by another student
 next year)?

 in the current grammar is essentially a multiline statement.
 It would be beneficial if the line between statement and defRhs could be
 eliminated.
 For instance, multiline statements could replace function calls in if-calls
 or a single line statement without brackets could serve as right hand side
 in a definition.

More IO

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing, print is the only type of IO that Fumurt has.
 It goes without saying that this is inadequate for serious usage.

This should include all the technical details (where is the code? what do
 you type to compile it? etc) that would enable a student to continue your
 project next year, to be able to amend your code and extend it.

Code listing

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Your code should be well commented.
 In order not to use up too many pages of your maximum 120 on code, you
 may like to use the 'a2ps' Unix facility, which allows you to put two pages
 of code onto one side of paper - see the Unix 'man' pages for details.
 If you have a great deal of code, and including all of it would take you
 over the page limit, you can make the rest available on a floppy disk or
 CD-ROM.
 You will need to bring in two copies of any disks or CDs you include when
 you hand in your project report, one to go with each copy of your project.
